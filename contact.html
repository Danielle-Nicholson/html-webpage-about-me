    <!-- 
      Forms are used for submitting data from a user to the server.
      The "action" attribute determines which page the data will be sent to.
      The "method" attribute determines whether the data will be stored in the URL or sent securely.
        -The "GET" method will store the data in the URL, meaning if the URL is sent to somebody, they will have the
        same exact page, as their URL will sent the same data to the server as the original request.
        -The "POST" method will submit the data behind the scenes, so if the URL is copied, none of the data
        will be included.
    -->
    <form action="contact.html" method="POST">
        <!-- 
          The label element is used kind of like a prompt for a form element. 
          The "for" attribute will tie the prompt to a form element by its ID.

        <label for="name">Please enter your name:</label>
        <input id="name" type="text">
        <!--
          The input element is used for several types of form fields including:
            -Basic one line text ("text")
            -Checkboxes ("checkbox")
            -Radio buttons ("radio")
            -Submit button ("submit")
          The type of element rendered is determined by the "type" attribute.
          The "id" attribute is used to globally identify an element on a page (for CSS / JS) as well as tie it to a label.
          The "name" attribute is used to determine what the field's data will be referred to when it is submitted to the server.
