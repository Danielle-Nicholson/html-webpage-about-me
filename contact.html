    Forms are used for submitting data from a user to the server.
    The "action" attribute determines which page the data will be sent to.
    The "method" attribute determines whether the data will be stored in the URL or sent securely.
      -The "GET" method will store the data in the URL, meaning if the URL is sent to somebody, they will have the
      same exact page, as their URL will sent the same data to the server as the original request.
      -The "POST" method will submit the data behind the scenes, so if the URL is copied, none of the data
      will be included.
